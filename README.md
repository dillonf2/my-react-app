# Cryptocurrency Popularity Contest

## Description
    This app was built from scratch using React in order to demonstrate my progress and understanding of the Phase 2 concepts of Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp. 

## Usage
    As the instructions explain on the home page, you can click on the Assets tab in order to view the cryptocurrency assets participating in the cryptocurrency popularity contest. Simply click on your favorite crypto in order to vote for it! 

    If you don't see your favorite cryptocurrency, you can click on the Submit tab and enter it into the contest. Afterwards, navigate back to the assets page and your asset will be there. Then you can click on it to vote for it!

## Authors and Acknowledgement
    My name is Frank Dillon, and I am the sole author of this application. I would like to extend thanks to Enoch Griffith, an instructor of Flatiron school that assisted me in understanding what is required in order to successfully deploy both the front and backend of my application, which I plan to do prior to completion of the course. Furthermore, he assited me in merging my local and Github repos and commit histories. Thank you Enoch!
